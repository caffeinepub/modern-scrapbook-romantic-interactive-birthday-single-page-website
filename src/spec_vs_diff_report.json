  "summary": "Most requested single-page scrapbook experience features appear implemented: vertically stacked sections with smooth scrolling, hero headline + countdown + hint CTA, alternating Journey paragraphs with 4 uploadable polaroids + editable captions, floating music player with local audio upload and fade/loop, Tease envelopes with “Open Me”, optional Our Spots pins with popovers, and Grand Finale with “Don't Click This”, high-intensity full-screen confetti, coupon reveal, plus optional password-gated video panel. The main clear gap is REQ-22 image asset file presence under frontend/public/assets/generated (not shown in diff).",
